### WARNING: THIS MODULE OVERRIDES THE DEFAULT ROLL FUNCTION! BECAUSE OF THIS IT ISNT COMPATIBLE WITH ANY OTHER MODULE THAT DOES SOMETHING LIKE THIS.
Luck For Rolls is a module that allows costumization for the chance of critical rolls to happen in Foundry VTT.

## Instalation

The module can be found on the foundry vtt module installer

## Usage

After installing the module it will just work in the background, tho a big part of the functionality is the costumization so I recomand you to chance the settings to your liking from the Settings -> Module Settings tab in Foundry.

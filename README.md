# Luck For Rolls 

Luck For Rolls is a module that allows costumization for the chance of critical rolls to happen in Foundry VTT.

Note: ATM doesn't work with Better Rolls 5e since that module does its rolls in a weird way and I am not sure if I want to support it.

## Instalation

Since it is not yet released this module can be installed using the manifest `https://github.com/HadaIonut/Foundry-LuckForRolls/releases/download/v0.0.1/module.json`

## Usage

After installing the module it will just work in the background, tho a big part of the functionality is the costumization so I recomand you to chance the settings to your liking from the Settings -> Module Settings tab in Foundry.

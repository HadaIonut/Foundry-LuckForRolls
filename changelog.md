# v0.0.2
This is the first release of Luck for Rolls.
Luck for Rolls is an system agnostic module that attempts to make the rolls feel a bit more natural.

The starting release has the following features:
- Adjustable starting point for critical chance
- Adjustable increment for critical chance
- The option to add a hard cap to critical chance
- Configurable die to have critical chance applied to
- Configurable value that is considered a critical hit
- Ability to allow the critical chance to be increased only on what the user defines as a "low roll"
- Ability to have only low rolls be transformed into critical rolls
- A critical prevention system that removes the chance for critical rolls to happen outside of the luck mechanic
